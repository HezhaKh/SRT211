# Local Ice-Cream Shop Order System

## Project Overview
This Python program is designed to digitize the order system of a local ice-cream shop, improving service efficiency and customer experience. It features a menu-driven interface allowing customers to select from a variety of ice-cream flavors, toppings, and sizes, with each choice affecting the overall order price.

## Features
- **Menu Options:** Choose from at least three ice-cream flavors (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry), three toppings (Nuts, Chocolate Chips, Sprinkles), and three sizes (Small, Medium, Large).
- **User Interaction:** A main menu displays options for flavors, toppings, and sizes. Users select their desired options via input choices.
- **Order Processing:** Calculates the total cost based on selections and displays a summary of choices and the total cost.
- **Looping and Control:** Allows adding multiple items to an order and completing the order to display the final cost.

## Implementation
- Utilizes data structures (e.g., dictionaries) for menu options and pricing.
- Incorporates functions for modularity and readability.
- Implements error handling for invalid inputs.
- Includes comments for code explanation and logic flow.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of menu options and data structures.
- Efficiency and clarity in user interaction.
- Accuracy of total order cost calculation and display.
- Use of looping and control structures for multiple orders.
- Implementation of error handling.
- Overall code readability and documentation.

## Submission Instructions
- The program is written in Python and should be submitted in `.py` file format.
- Ensure the code runs without errors in a standard Python environment.
- Submit the code before the specified deadline.
